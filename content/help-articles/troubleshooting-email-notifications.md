### Common Reasons for Missing Emails

Portal notifications are delivered automatically from `no-reply@mohs.gov.sl`. If you are not receiving them:

#### 1. Check Spam or Junk Folders

- Search for messages from `no-reply@mohs.gov.sl`.
- Mark the email as **Not Spam** to whitelist the sender.

#### 2. Update Safe Sender Lists

- Add the email address to your safe sender list in Gmail, Outlook, or Yahoo Mail.
- For institutional accounts, request that the IT department whitelist the domain `mohs.gov.sl`.

#### 3. Review Inbox Rules

- Ensure there are no filters moving messages to folders automatically.
- Remove forwarding rules that might redirect the notification.

#### 4. Confirm the Email on Your Profile

- Sign in to the portal and verify the email listed under **Account Settings**.
- Update the address if you no longer have access to it.

> **Tip:** After making changes, send a test notification from the portal to confirm delivery.

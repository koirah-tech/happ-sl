### Activation Overview

Once a payroll PIN is issued, it must be activated across multiple government systems before it becomes usable for payroll submissions.

#### Typical Timeline

1. **Day 0:** PIN issued by MoHS credentialing unit.
2. **Day 1–3:** PIN registered with the Human Resource Management Office (HRMO).
3. **Day 4–7:** Payroll integration and verification.

Expect activation within **7 business days** of issue.

#### How to Check Activation

1. Visit the **Verify Credentials** page.
2. Enter your credential ID or scan the QR code.
3. Confirm the **Verification Date** shown on the success page.

If the verification date is older than seven days but your PIN is still inactive, contact the HR desk.

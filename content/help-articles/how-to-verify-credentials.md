### Verifying a credential is a simple and secure process

This guide will walk you through the two official methods available on the portal.

#### Method 1: QR Code Scan

1. Navigate to the **Verify Credentials** page.
2. Select **Activate Camera &amp; Scan QR Code**.
3. Allow the browser to access your device camera.
4. Hold the QR code from the digital credential steady inside the frame.

The system detects the credential instantly and shows you a success or failure page.

#### Method 2: Manual ID Entry

If a camera is unavailable, you can type the credential ID manually.

- Locate the alphanumeric ID on the document (e.g., `MOHS-DOC-98765`).
- Enter the ID into the **Credential ID** field on the verification page.
- Click **Verify Credential** to submit.

> **Tip:** If the ID returns an error, double-check for typos or contact MoHS support.

#### Troubleshooting

- **No camera detected:** Use the manual ID entry option.
- **Permission denied:** Enable camera permissions in your browser settings and try again.
- **Verification failed:** Confirm the ID with the health professional, or email `support@mohs.gov.sl`.

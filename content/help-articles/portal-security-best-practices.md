### Why Security Matters

The MoHS portal handles sensitive personal and professional records. Maintaining strong security helps prevent unauthorized access and data leaks.

#### Recommended Practices

1. **Use unique passwords** for the MoHS portalâ€”never reuse passwords from other systems.
2. **Log out** after completing official tasks, especially on shared devices.
3. **Avoid public Wi-Fi** when submitting or approving applications.
4. **Verify URLs** before entering credentials. The official portal uses the `mohs.gov.sl` domain.

#### Reporting Security Incidents

- Email `security@mohs.gov.sl` immediately if you suspect unauthorized access.
- Provide the credential ID involved, the time of the incident, and any evidence (screenshots/logs).

#### Future Enhancements

The digital services team is rolling out:

- Multi-factor authentication for portal access.
- Automated alerts for sign-ins from new locations.
- Audit dashboards that display verification attempts in real-time.

> **Stay vigilant:** Security is a shared responsibility between MoHS and its users.
